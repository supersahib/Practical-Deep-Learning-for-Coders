# Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Learning Journey

My hands-on exploration of deep learning through the **Practical Deep Learning for Coders** course, building production-ready AI systems from day one.

## Overview

This repository documents my transition from software engineering to ML/AI engineering, focusing on practical implementations over theory. Each lesson combines working code with detailed notes on core concepts, FastAI documentation, and engineering best practices.

## Course Structure

### Lesson 1: Image Classification
- **Notebook**: [`practical-deep-learning-for-coders-lesson-1.ipynb`](practical-deep-learning-for-coders-lesson-1.ipynb)
- **Key Concepts**: Transfer learning, DataLoaders, ResNet architecture
- **Results**: 97.3% accuracy bird vs forest classifier in under 1 minute of training
- **Tech Stack**: FastAI, DuckDuckGo image search, Kaggle environment


## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: FastAI (built on PyTorch)
- **Environment**: Kaggle Notebooks with GPU
- **Data Sources**: DuckDuckGo image search, public datasets
- **Tools**: Jupyter, Python, Git

## Notes Format

All notes are structured for easy import into Obsidian:
- Markdown format with clear headings
- Code snippets with explanations
- FastAI documentation references
- Engineering insights and best practices

## Key Learnings So Far

**Transfer Learning Power**: Achieved professional-grade results (97.3% accuracy) by leveraging pre-trained ResNet18 models instead of training from scratch.

**FastAI Philosophy**: The framework emphasizes practical results over theoretical complexity - complex ML workflows reduced to a few lines of readable code.

**Data Pipeline**: Modern ML is more about data organization and preprocessing than algorithm implementation.

## Course Resources

- [Fast.AI Course](https://course.fast.ai/)
- [FastAI Documentation](https://docs.fast.ai/)
- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders Book](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook)

## Running the Code

1. Clone this repository
2. Open notebooks in Kaggle or Google Colab (GPU recommended)
3. Install FastAI: `pip install fastai`
4. Run cells sequentially

Each notebook is self-contained with setup instructions and data download code.
